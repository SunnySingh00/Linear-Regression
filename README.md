# Linear-Regression
This is a programming assignment done for the CSCI 567 - Machine Learning class.

The code above implements Linear, Ridge and Polynomial Regression with the metric of evaluation being Mean Absolute Error(MAE).

linear_regression.py implements the algorithm for Linear, Ridge and Polynomial Regression. This is a complete implementation that is also provided with a test dataset on wine qualities.

To run the above code: $ python linear_regression_test.py
